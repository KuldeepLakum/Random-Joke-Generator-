## How It Works 🛠️
1. On page load, the app makes an API call to fetch a random joke
2. The response is parsed and displayed in two sections:
   - Setup (Question/Statement)
   - Punchline (Answer/Punch)
3. Users can click the button to fetch a new joke
4. The interface updates dynamically with the new content

## Key Features Breakdown 🔍
- **API Integration**: Uses Fetch API with async/await
- **Error Handling**: Catches network/API errors gracefully
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with media queries
- **UI/UX**: Interactive button with hover effects
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and proper contrast ratios

## Installation & Usage 🚀
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KuldeepLakum/random-joke-generator.git
